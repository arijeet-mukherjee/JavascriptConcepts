**call apply bind in javaScript**

Working with ```this```, in JS.

The ```bind()``` method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value.

The ```call()``` method calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.

```call()``` and ```apply()``` serve the exact same purpose. The only difference between how they work is that 
```call()``` expects all parameters to be passed in individually, whereas ```apply()``` expects an array of all of our parameters.
